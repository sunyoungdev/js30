  // array => reference  
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    console.log(players, team); // ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Lux"]

  // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice(); // slice() can copy the array
    team2[3] = 'Lux2';
    console.log(players, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Lux3';
    console.log(players, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Lux4';
    console.log(players, team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Lux5';
    console.log(players, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

  // Objects => reference
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(person, captain); // {name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number: 99}

  // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(person, cap2);  // {name: "Wes Bos", age: 80} {name: "Wes Bos", age: 80, number: 99}

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log(person, cap3);  // {name: "Wes Bos", age: 80} {name: "Wes Bos", age: 80}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
